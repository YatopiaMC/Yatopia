## So what is Yatopia?
Yatopia combines the code from many [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) forks and optimization mods, as well as many unique optimizations. We borrow code from the following repos:

* [Akarin](https://github.com/Akarin-project/Akarin)
* [EMC](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft)
* [Lithium](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric)
* [Origami](https://github.com/Minebench/Origami)
* [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur)
* [Airplane](https://github.com/Technove/Airplane)


## Try it out 
The latest stable builds of Yatopia are always available over at our [downloads page](https://yatopiamc.org/download.html). You can also download the latest development build [here](https://api.yatopiamc.org/v2/latestBuild/download?branch=ver/1.16.5).

## Documentation

 You can find a full explanation of the Yatopia configuration file on the [wiki](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia/wiki). Check out the list of patches included in this project and who created them [here](PATCHES.md).

## Building and setting up

Run the following commands in the root directory:

```shell
./gradlew initGitSubmodules
./gradlew setupUpstream
./gradlew applyPatches
./gradlew paperclip
```


## Using Yatopia-API

To build your plugin against the Yatopia-API, first add the CodeMC maven repository:

# Maven
Add the CodeMC Repo:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>codemc-repo</id>
        <url>https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-public/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

And then add the Yatopia-API dependency:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.yatopiamc</groupId>
        <artifactId>yatopia-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.16.5-R0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

# Gradle

> Groovy DSL

Add the CodeMC Repo:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-public/'
    }
}
```

And then add the Yatopia-API dependency:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'org.yatopiamc:yatopia-api:1.16.5-R0.1-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

> Kotlin DSL

Add the CodeMC Repo:
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-public/")
}
```

And then add the Yatopia-API dependency:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    compileOnly("org.yatopiamc:yatopia-api:1.16.5-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

## Why aren't there many API additions?

(Modified from [starlis/empirecraft](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft/))
<p>
APIs are tough to design. In projects such as Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge, Paper, etc once an API is committed, it's almost forever. You can't go breaking it without solid justification. This is the politics game.

With that in mind, much thought has to be given to the API in now and future use cases and applications to ensure it can be extended without breaking.

This is a lot of politics that we don't have time in our lives to deal with. 

That being said we make light API additions when requested.
