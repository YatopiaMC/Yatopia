Subject: [PATCH] Send more packets immediately

Paper did some changes around packet sending by introducing a queue and making (most of) the PLAY packets
send synchronously. This is completely fine, however the are some people who want to have better experience
with "cosmetic" stuff such as boss bar's, title's and scoreboard's. We allow those packets to pass instantly,
as the server shouldn't really care about those packets - they're not related with overall gameplay.

Additionally, I'm thinking of making those packets send asynchronously.
